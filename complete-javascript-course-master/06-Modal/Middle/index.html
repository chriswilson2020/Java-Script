        This is our retro number guessing game. I have thought of a number
        between one and twenty. It is your job to guess that number in as little
        guesses as possible. Once you finished you can try again by clicking the
        "again? button. Your highscore will be retained until you refresh the
        page. Good luck and as always may the odds be ever in your favour!
